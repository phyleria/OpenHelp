## Looking to get started on Opensource projects to enhance your Python skills. Check out this list of projects to get you going:
1. `https://github.com/Python-World/python-mini-projects`  Has a curated list of 102 starter projects to help you test your Python Skills 

2. `https://github.com/3b1b/manim` Manim or Mathematical Animation Engine is an animation engine for explanatory math videos. It is basically used to create animations programmatically. Manim runs on Python 3.7. 
You can install it from PyPI via pip: pip3 install manimlib

3. `https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRoboticsPython` Robotics is a Python code collection of robotics algorithms. It is a project mainly used for autonomous navigation. The code is easy to read for understanding the basic idea of each algorithm. Python Robotics runs on Python 3.7 and the requirements include NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and cvxpy. 

4. `https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike` XSStrike is a cross-site scripting detection suite which is equipped with four handwritten parsers, an intelligent payload generator, a powerful fuzzing engine, and a fast crawler. XSStrike analyses the response with multiple parsers and then crafts payloads that are guaranteed to work by context analysis integrated with a fuzzing engine. It also has crawling, fuzzing, parameter discovery, WAF detection capabilities.
